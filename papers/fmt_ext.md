# Extensions for FMT*

- One of the extensions of FMT* makes connections based on k-nearest neighbours which makes the algorithm more adaptive to different obstacle spaces.
- Another extension involves generating a heuristics to enable non-uniform sampling such that they are closer to the optimal path. One such way of generating non-uniform samples utilizes GANs to segment the input map into regions with varying priorities.
